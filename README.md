An app that aims to help students reflect on their emotions and work out what's affecting them at school

# An App related to Tech for Better
[Tech for Better](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/techforbetter/) is a pro-bono programme for nonprofits to design, test and build new digital service ideas using developers in London and Gaza.

## About the client
Nightingale is the result of two co-founders, Aaron and George, aiming towards the creation of an innovative analytical software tool for the early identification of mental health and wellbeing concerns in schools. 
Nightingale was not created just from professional insight but also from personal experience of mental health. It is this personal experience that drives this company to ensure that it builds a software that creates a lasting and meaningful impact on all those that use it.

## About the MVP
This current version of the app is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focussing on the most relevant features and needs. Working in agile software development it is important to constantly test products with users. MVPs can be taken out as proof-of-concepts challenging own pre-assumptions and to eventually improve digitalised ideas and needs.

#### Note:
The (MVP) was designed and built over the course of 4 weeks (1 design sprint, user testing and 2 build sprints). 

## What the app does
Working with Aaron and George withing several definition workshops narrowed down the scope and created the idea of producing a chat-bot that students could use in order to become aware of the relation between school and mental health. 
The mobile-first web-app allows students to create an account and start chatting to the nightingale bot. Based on an extensively designed conversation flow model (see image) the bot asks the user about his/ her individual experiences at school. The bot stores their favourite/ least favourite subjects and the days on which they're having those subjects. It also asks them about their experiences on that day related to the subject. But the bot also asks about other factors related to mental health of individuals at school such as connections with classmates and teachers. Moreover the bot gives a user room to self-reflect about their day at school by allowing them to freely write about experiences/ feelings. The bot is storing a some key events such as subjects and creates weekly events based on the days a student has their favourite/ least favourite subject. A student can chat to the bot on a daily basis and the conversations are being stored per day. One special feature of the app is that a student is always asked to rate the day at school (mood rankings between amazing and terrible). Those moods are being stored and an average mood per day is calculated and shown to the student. Demonstrating possible connections between experiences at school and mental wellbeing can give the user the ability to evaluate and realise trends. A user can always log onto the app and see all past conversations and related moods. 
As a means of security a key-word analysis on the student's text input operates in the background creating immediate email-alerts to notify the product owners.

As stated above what has been built to date is a MVP that will enable the product owner to do further user testing.
